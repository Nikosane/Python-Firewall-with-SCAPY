# Python-Firewall-with-SCAPY

A firewall essentially works by filtering traffic based on certain rules, such as allowing or blocking packets based on IP address, port number, or protocol. You can achieve this using Python libraries like scapy, socket, and iptables (if you're using a Linux system) to build the firewall. Below is an overview of how you can create a basic Python firewall.
**Steps to Build a Basic Python Firewall**
1. **Use `scapy` for Packet Sniffing and Filtering**: `scapy` is a powerful Python library for packet manipulation and analysis. You can use it to intercept and analyze network packets, apply filtering rules, and decide whether to drop or allow the packet.
2. **Socket Programming for Packet Handling**: You can also use Python's `socket` library to create low-level network connections and control how packets are routed through the system.
3. **Using `iptables` (Linux)**: On a Linux system, you can combine Python with system tools like `iptables` to implement firewall rules that directly interact with the OS networking stack.

# Simple Python Firewall Example Using `scapy`

Hereâ€™s a basic example of a Python firewall that uses scapy to monitor network traffic and decide whether to allow or block certain packets based on predefined rules.

Requirements:
- Install scapy using pip install scapy
- Python 3.x
