# Python Firewall with Packet Filtering and Logging

This project implements a simple network firewall using Python and scapy. It filters packets based on IP addresses and ports, detects IP spoofing, logs allowed and blocked packets, and can even redirect HTTP traffic to another port.

**Features**:
- Port Filtering: Block or allow traffic based on destination ports.
- Logging: Record allowed and blocked packets in a log file.
- Packet Redirection: Redirect specific traffic (e.g., HTTP on port 80) to another IP/port.
- IP Spoofing Detection: Basic detection of packets with spoofed source IP addresses.
